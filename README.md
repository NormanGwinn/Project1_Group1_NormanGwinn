This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to analyze the COVID-19 dataset from John Hopkins.

The goal of the notebook is provide a framework for loading the summary and time series data sets.

The notebook is parameterized for:

* Location of the COVID-19 dataset
* Date of study

On this framework, I chose to study:

* Trends for countries, based on onset of the virus in each country
* An exponential curve fit
